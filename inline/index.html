<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about a new cooking technique called <em>sous vide</em>.
   In <em>sous vide</em> cooking,
   you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the
   target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em>, Jeff Potter describes
   it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving <b><em>Sous Vide</em> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b> To reserve a seat at the chef table,
  contact us before November 30.</p>
